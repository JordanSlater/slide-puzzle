First I want to create the board through for loops

- [x] Time completion time
- [ ] Make splits
    - [x] Identify number of tiles in the correct position
    - [ ] Keep record of times when tiles were completed
    - [ ] overwrite previous times when number of tiles decreases
- [ ] add replay feature....?
    - [ ] record every board state
- [ ]
